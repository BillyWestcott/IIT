<h1>Interest in IT</h1>

<p>What is your interest in IT?</p>
<br>
<p>My interest in IT as of now is a broad one. I would not like to say I am specifically more interested in one area than another. What I am interested in is the variety of skill sets, tools and knowledge I can acquire from a forever evolving industry filled with a plethora of innovators and leaders. I am interested in a constantly changing work environment where I am challenged every day to grow. I am especially interested in the ability to work in almost any industry with a good work and life balance.</p>

<p>When did your interest in IT start?</p>
<br>
<p>My interest in IT evolves from me as a child seeing an ever-growing industry blossom into what it is today, which is the powerhouse of innovation and inspiration. From a young age, I began taking apart old electronics to investigate the inner workings of what I believed to be partially magic at the time. Although this sounds a lot like I was an engineer in a child’s body my main interest as a child and now wasn’t the physical properties of technology I had a major interest in, it was the function the technology could do. Transferring information, displaying an image and production of sounds were and still are fascinating to me.</p>
