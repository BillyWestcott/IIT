  <h1>Interest in IT</h1>

  <p>  -What is your interest in IT?</p>
  <p>My interest in IT as of now is a broad one. I would not like to say I am specifically more interested in one area than another. What I am interested in is the variety of skill sets, tools and knowledge I can acquire from a forever evolving industry filled with a plethora of innovators and leaders. I am interested in a constantly changing work environment where I am challenged every day to grow. I am especially interested in the ability to work in almost any industry with a good work and life balance.</p>
  <br>

  <p>  -When did your interest in IT start?</p>
  <p>My interest in IT evolves from me as a child seeing an ever-growing industry blossom into what it is today, which is the powerhouse of innovation and inspiration. From a young age, I began taking apart old electronics to investigate the inner workings of what I believed to be partially magic at the time. Although this sounds a lot like I was an engineer in a child’s body my main interest as a child and now wasn’t the physical properties of technology I had a major interest in, it was the function the technology could do. Transferring information, displaying an image and production of sounds were and still are fascinating to me.</p>
  <br>

  <p>  -Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</p>
  <p>I was bound to end up having an interest in IT. Growing up having a father in graphic design a mother in administration and brothers that could not get enough of World of Warcraft left me bound to find this passion.</p>
  <br>

  <p>  -Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </p>
  <p>I chose to study with RMIT as I had always heard great things about them being a good University and I had also heard great things about their online programs. Safe to say since commencing study I have been extremely impressed with the structure of the course and its deliverance.</p>
  <br>

  <p>  -What do you expect to learn during your studies?</p>
  <p>I expect to learn a combination of things including different knowledge and practical skills about the IT industry. I hope these include aspects of IT support, design, security and many more.</p>
