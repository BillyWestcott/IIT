<h1>My Project Idea - 'PatientID'</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>I propose to plan, develop and build a complete android-based patient data management, tracking and alteration application. This application’s key purpose is to allow for the universal exchange of patient details among certified doctors, hospital staff and other medical professionals across the public and private sectors. These details will be able to be altered over time to account for new medical history, prescriptions, appointments and other relevant information for medical practitioners. This application will also be able to track patients of choice, for example, a person who has contracted COVID-19 or other future sicknesses. I will call this application ‘PatientID’.</p>
<br>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Having access to ‘PatientID’ will streamline all visits to the doctor, hospital or any medical specialist not only for the practitioner but for the patient themselves. No longer will doctors need elaborate interfaces on old and slow computers in order to read and log information about a patient. No longer will a patient be reliable for remembering names of medications, date and times of appointments. No longer will receptionists need to constantly take calls and log appointments all day. No longer will it be important to book the same doctors, let alone the same practice every time you need to see a practitioner. ‘PatientID’ would revolutionise ease of access all around to medical practitioners and patients and increase the overall efficiency of the medical sector.</p>
<br>

<h3>Description</h3>
<h4>  -Concept</h4>
<p>‘PatientID’ will be an opt-in medical service application dedicated to making medical visits a breeze.</p>

<h4>  -Usability</h4>
<p>Users will need to sign-up via the apps login/signup page and then login using those details to receive a unique QR code. This QR code is used for making each account unique for patients, and to allow medical professionals to scan and then therefore log patient’s information. </p>

<h4>  -Features</h4>
<p>Once an account is formed a patient will be prompted to enter their current medical details. These details will include prescriptions, current and past health issues, immunisation records, surgery records, x-rays and all other relevant medical history. Each different detail will have a separate page within the application, and all medical practitioners will be able to access their patient’s information by scanning the patients QR code from their phone. Once scanned, the patient’s details will all be logged within the medical practitioner’s application ready to be exported into the specific practice’s own records. The application will also include a tab for the user’s birth certificate for verification purposes.</p>

<p>Each patient will have the option to opt-in or opt-out of any service, practice or medical facilities ability to log their information. This allows for comfortability using the app knowing your details will not be logged without your permission.</p>

<p>Patients using the application will have the ability to book appointments, cancel appointments, see future and previous appointments, and a list of all available appointments.</p>

<p>‘PatientID’ will be accessible to both private and public sectors and will in-term create a new relationship between the two sectors in order to better our healthcare system overall.</p>

<p>‘PatientID’ will also receive updates to include new relevant information as Australia’s health system improves. These updates will include functionality in-case of a global health crisis such as a pandemic, this functionality would come in the form of a tracking tab used to track patients via their phones GPS.</p>
<br>

<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>In order to create a project of this scale a vast amount of resources will be required. Multiple workstations coding multiple different aspects. Multiple graphic designers, designing different tabs. As this application would be android-based the application itself may overall be made in Java which is the official language for Android development. Open source tools such as <a href="https://github.com/nayuki/QR-Code-generator">Nayuki’s QR code generator</a> and <a href="http://trikita.co/obsqr/">obsqr QR code scanner</a>  will be vital in the development of this application.</p>
<br>

<h3>Skills Required</h3>
<p>In order to complete this project, I would need multiple years of experience within Java and other coding languages including multiple years using the Android development kit. Software needs to be written for the skeleton of the application, each new tab, how the apps communicate and interact, how the app logs information. Software also needs to be written for the communication between the application and specific surgeries own software for logging, and the GPS tracking aspect as well.</p>
<br>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>If ‘PatientID’ were to be successful it would mean many positive things for Australia and its residents. We would have a much more highly optimised medical system allowing for potential budget cuts and an increase in focus where it is really needed. ‘PatientID’ would help revolutionise how Australians see healthcare, and no longer will the consensus be that it is a burden.</p>
