    <p>The job that I have selected to be my ideal job in the IT industry is as an IT Director for MI World Ltd. MI World is a Multiple Intelligence Education Agency dedicated to helping parents understand their children’s specific combinations of intellectual traits to help guide families into an environment where their child will thrive.</p>

    <p>As an IT Director my job would be to oversee most of all operations regarding technology to evaluate and manipulate the operations to address specific goals; establish several different IT systems and policies that would be targeted towards the strategies my management has set out for me; determine the needs of each department of the business regarding technology and in term purchase cost-effective and efficient equipment, also making sure that said equipment is up to date and is being used to full functionality; supervise and coordinate the rest of the IT team; control and report on budget and assist in building new relationships with vendors for IT equipment, software and product.</p>

    <p>At MI World the IT Director’s “typical work week may include adding a new component to the webpage, working on the backend of the LMS, tech troubleshooting, supporting an Educator Director in creating an app, etc.”</p>

    <p>This job has a lot of appealing qualities for me. The main appeal that this job has for me is the fact that it is a completely remote, work from home position. It also has a huge number of responsibilities and a broad range of IT skills are needed to able to fulfill those responsibilities, I want my future job to be full of new content and to change daily.</p>

    <p>To be considered for this role you first need to have several years’ experience in IT coordination or management, working as one of the backbones to all IT related needs within an organization or a singular project in an organization; experience in designing learning courses or curriculum is desired but no crucial; experience in the designing of websites is desired; the ability to train newly hired people in your sector of the business; experience with app building and design software; the ability to analyse a project and make strategic decisions based around it and the ability to multi-take on several diverse projects at the same time in a successful manner.</p>

    <p>As you can see this job would have to be a long term goal for me as the requirements to be even considered are nowhere in my ballpark as of yet, but this doesn’t mean I could not make a long term plan to meet those requirements. First of all, I need to complete my bachelor’s degree, making sure to select specific subjects along the way that would leave me with experience in web design, app design and analysis of a business in order to land a job in the future in IT coordination or management. Ideally, after landing this job I would study some form of learning design and develop my knowledge in the fields specific to the IT Director position at MI World Ltd. Each requirement I end up meeting will help increase my chance of landing this job and so I would need to take every learning opportunity I could along the way.</p>
