  <h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you? </h3>
  <p>These results reflect on several different aspects of me personally. My Myers-Briggs test results show that I have the personality type of an Advocate which indicates my life is about taking concrete steps to achieve a goal that usually focuses on helping others. My Learning styles test results indicate that my ideal way of learning is the theorist style which is defined by thinking through problems in a logical manner, valuing rationality and objectivity. Finally, the results of my Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale test results show that in terms of conspiracies I do not believe in very many of them, yet my result is higher than the average.</p>

  <h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
  <p>These results have several implications when it comes to my personal behaviour in a team. For one, the Myers-Briggs test indicates that as an advocate I should “identify others’ motives and defuse conflicts”. As an advocate I value working together as a team, encouraging hard work and love to help others when needed. The Learning Styles test indicates that I would go into a team seeking rationality and objectivity, and if I do not find these things I will more than likely fit things into a new rational order. The Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale test results indicate to me that I may find it hard to not discuss politics when working in a team environment.</p>
  <br>

  <h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
  <p>These results indicate that when forming a team, I should look for like-minded individuals that want to get the same thing out of a project as me. I should consider looking for people that want to approach every new situation and question with logic and objectivity and people that are willing to help one another. I also need to consider a balance of both objectivity and subjectivity so I should consider people from the opposite end of the personality spectrum in order to do so.</p>
